             33 commercially purchased antibodies tested, 21 included in the final. 
             For the 21 in the final, summing the difference between supplier
             recommended and optimal dilution pricing per test, the total savings would be :blue[$54.61/test].""")

             supplier number of tests at 25, the price difference from the supplier's recommened to 
             optimal dilution is $-8.6, demonstrating that ording the vial in what one would normally do

    st.write("""A major savings in cost comes from employee time spent in optimizing or having to redo an expirement because
             and antibody failed due to a bad dilution. Traditionally, purchasing amounts have been done by a history kept at the lab,
             what someone did before that worked, or hours and hours of research. Assuming a lab manager salary of 
             \$90,000/year or \$45/hour, not including benefits, then for every 8 hours spent reading published papers, optimizing, 
             reording, or other complications would correlate to :blue[$360/day] not counting material cost as well.
